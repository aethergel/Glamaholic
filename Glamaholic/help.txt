# How to use Glamaholic

Thank you for installing Glamaholic! This plugin can act as your home for
glamours, since you can store as many as you would like in it. To get started,
try reading the section called "Adding glamour plates". Keep in mind that you'll
need to be editing your plates at the Glamour Dresser to be able to copy those
plates into the plugin or apply new plates.

# Finding items that share a model

You can search for items that share the same model as another item by either
middle-clicking (click with mouse wheel) or holding Control and left-clicking on 
any item name or item icon. This will open a window listing items with the same
model where you can link or try them on.
